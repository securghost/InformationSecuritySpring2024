**This talk:**

**Scenario:**

  **Attacker** - unprivileged attacker with foothold in the environment
  **User** - pentesters using offensive security tooling agains a target
  **Victim** - the systems targeted by pentesters (and attackers)

 - kind of lame (just examples)
 - good enough
 - still used by pentesters (and real attackers)
 - ported to other languages / frameworks

**Disclaimer**

   "The example scripts in impacket are just that, example scripts and are     not meant to be used in a procuction system."

- PR in Github are incoming (no CVEs)
- His code is released once PR are done.
- This talk is not about avoiding detection!
