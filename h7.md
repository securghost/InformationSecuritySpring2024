**This report follows the rule - from latest to first. Meaning first task is the last in the report, and last is the first.**

## a) Voluntary: Feed me. Set up RSS feed reader and follow some security related feeds.

I opened extentsions in my firefox browser and browsed for RSS feed:

I chose the option that was recommended by firefox and also with the most users:

## x) Free tickets. View and summarize a hacker or security conference presentation. It should be a full length (>30 min) presentation. Brief summary with some bullets is enough.

### [[Disobey 2023] Finding vulnerabilities in offensive security tooling - Jonas Vestberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGSWNXa4XmU)

**This talk:**

**Scenario:**

  **Attacker** - unprivileged attacker with foothold in the environment
  **User** - pentesters using offensive security tooling agains a target
  **Victim** - the systems targeted by pentesters (and attackers)

**Impacket** example scripts
 - kind of lame (just examples)
 - good enough
 - still used by pentesters (and real attackers)
 - ported to other languages / frameworks

**Disclaimer**

   "The example scripts in impacket are just that, example scripts and are     not meant to be used in a procuction system."

- PR in Github are incoming (no CVEs)
- His code is released once PR are done.
- This talk is not about avoiding detection!

**Impacket**

"Impacket is a collection of Phython classes for working with network protocols."

SMB, MS-RPC, etc
Hacking Windows from Linux
Use with password/ticket/hash

Example scripts:
- secretsdump.py
- smbexec.py
- psexec.py


**secretsdump.py**

"Performs various techniques to dump hashes from the remote machine without executing any agent there". 

- Post-exploitation
- Dump registry secrets remotely

  The dumped secrets

- Service credentials in clear text
- Password hashed of local users (crack or pass the hash)
- Password of computer account (if domain joined)
- Cached credentials of interactive logins (crack)

$ impacket-secretsdump domain/adminuser@target

1. Enable remote registry
2. Get boot key (deobfuscate data in SYSTEM hive)
3. Save SAM hive to C:\Windows\System32\[random].tmp
4. Extract local hashes from \\target\admin$\System32\[random].tmp
5. Save SECURITY hive to C:\Windows\System32\[random].tmp
6. Extract LSA secrets from \\target\admin$\System32\[random].tmp
7. Remove temporary files and disable remote registry

**Demo**

- Unprivileged attacker on the target.
- Pentester use secretdump.py agains the target

**local privesc**

1. Wait for [random].tmp files in C:\Windows\System32
2. Copy [random].tmp files in C:\Windows\System32
3. Get boot key
4. Dump local hashes and LSA secrets
5. Pass the hash of local admin or create a silver ticket with computer account (if domain joined)

Same code used in or ported to:
- CrackMapExec
- Metasploit (auxiliary/gather/windows_secrets_dump)
- ?

Intrestingly, the documentation in the script said that it was suppose to be saving it into temp file, however, Jonas could not verified it. 

**This is the SharpSecDump:**

**Metasploit:**

Just to show, it works with this one as well:

![image](https://github.com/securghost/InformationSecuritySpring2024/assets/142783540/6bb8d25b-b072-4dac-9416-b9d95fc0e036)


**Solution:**

- Save the registry hives to C:\Windows\Temp\
  -- Unprivileged users cannot list files
  -- Only admins and the owner can read.

That's how it looks:

**smbexec.py tool**

"A similar approach to psexec w/o using RemComSvc."

- Laternal movement
- Run code as SYSTEM

$ impacket-smbexec domain/adminuser@target

1. Start new service on target named "BTOBTO"
2. Command written to C:\Windows\Temp\execute.bat
3. Execute C:\Windows\Temp\execute.bat
4. Read command output from \\target\c$\__output

Service binPath is set to a command-line with the command
echo "command >__output" > execute.bat & execute.bat del execute.bat

On the right we have attacker running a tool and on the left pentester:

This it how it looks when vulnerable:

About 20 minutes in the video, I realized that this particular video is supertechnical for me and seems that I should have some base knowledge about the topic as underrstanding what is going on in that video was some-what challenging. And even though this topic is rather interesting for myself, I decided to put it on the shelf and come back sometime later, when I have gotten myself familiar with the topic.
