**This report follows the rule - from latest to first. Meaning first task is the last in the report, and last is the first.**

## d) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.

We did this in class. To get the bitcoin address of the vendor, purchase has to be made. It is strongly advisable to NOT use one's own name and credits. But also no other credits (usernames) used somewhere else as a identifier of yourself. 

Once we got the bitcoin address, we could check the assets with Bitcoin explorer, https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. As the bitcoin wallet that we checked out, was for violent crime agains humans, the balance was 0€. Which, for me, was somewhat relief. 

## b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

   ### b.1) search engine for onion sites. We used the ahmia (fi) browser by searching it from the search engine

   ### marketplace

In the marketplace one can find options to buy weed, hash, kush, vape, capsules, money transfers, credit cards, weapons/guns and other things. I did took a look what was under the other categhory, but can't remember enymore. I also noticed, that mainly there were possible to purchase passports for USA, Canada and few places more (all togehter, I think there was 5 options). However, Finnish was not one of them.

   ### forum

I was able to find few forums, however, they didn't seem to be very much alive. Meaning, there was not much traffic going on. Almost leaving me wonder, what am I missing or why was it so lifeless.

   ### a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

   I did find presence of the BBC in the darkweb.

## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

I started by visiting the website: https://www.torproject.org/download/. Then I downloaded the TOR browser for Linux.

As I did all of the assignments in the class, I do not have many screenshots to offer. However, after downloading, I opened my terminal and gave following commands:

    $ cd downloads
    $ tar -xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.0.10.tar.xz
    $ cd tor-browser
    $ ./start.tor-browser.desktop

After giving those commands I was able to open the TOR browser.

Before I could start browsing, I had to click the connect button:

## x) Read and summarize (briefly, e.g. with some bullets)

### [Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

1. Tor, the anonymous browsing network, is still effective despite attempts by the NSA to compromise it. While certain Tor users have been compromised in specific situations, Tor's design assumes that at least one side of the connection is not being monitored. The main attacks on Tor are side-channel attacks on browser bugs or user misconfiguration and traffic correlation attacks.
2. Another common misconception is that Tor is only used by criminals and pedophiles. In reality, Tor is used by activists, the military, families, journalists, and others to protect their privacy and anonymity.
3. Tor does not have a military backdoor and has been audited by experts to confirm its security.
4. Running a Tor relay in the US is not illegal, although there is no guarantee that law enforcement won't contact you, especially if you operate an exit relay. However, using Tor for criminal activity can bring more scrutiny to the entire network. Contrary to popular belief.
5. Tor is easy to use with the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails, a live operating system that routes your entire Internet connection through Tor.
6. Tor is Not as Slow as You Think

    "It is true that Tor is slower than a regular Internet connection. However, the Tor developers have been doing a lot of hard work to make the Tor network faster."

8. Tor is Not Foolproof. It is important to always use Tor Browser Bundle or Tails and make sure to keep your software up to date so you wouldn't destroy your own anonymity with Tor by using it incorrectly.

### [Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser €; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0015)

The Tor Browser, also known as The Onion Router (Tor), allows for anonymous communication over the internet. It anonymizes users by hiding their IP addresses, making it nearly impossible to trace or identify them. It is widely used for browsing the internet and sending emails without being identified. Tor was initially developed by the US government in 2002 but is now open for improvements by anyone with technical ability. It is used worldwide to connect to blocked websites, facilitate anonymous communication, and maintain privacy. However, Tor can also be used for criminal activities. Forensically examining devices with Tor artifacts is one way to analyze Tor, focusing on Windows operating systems. The other perspective is defeating Tor to capture communications or identify suspects who are currently using it. Tor works by directing a user's internet traffic through random relays and encrypting the data multiple times. The encrypted data passes through entry, middle, and exit relays before connecting to the user's desired target with an unencrypted connection. Overall, Tor provides effective anonymity and poses challenges for forensic analysis and investigation.
