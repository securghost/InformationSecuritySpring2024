### [Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

1. Tor, the anonymous browsing network, is still effective despite attempts by the NSA to compromise it. While certain Tor users have been compromised in specific situations, Tor's design assumes that at least one side of the connection is not being monitored. The main attacks on Tor are side-channel attacks on browser bugs or user misconfiguration and traffic correlation attacks.
2. Another common misconception is that Tor is only used by criminals and pedophiles. In reality, Tor is used by activists, the military, families, journalists, and others to protect their privacy and anonymity.
3. Tor does not have a military backdoor and has been audited by experts to confirm its security.
4. Running a Tor relay in the US is not illegal, although there is no guarantee that law enforcement won't contact you, especially if you operate an exit relay. However, using Tor for criminal activity can bring more scrutiny to the entire network. Contrary to popular belief.
5. Tor is easy to use with the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails, a live operating system that routes your entire Internet connection through Tor.
6. Tor is Not as Slow as You Think

    "It is true that Tor is slower than a regular Internet connection. However, the Tor developers have been doing a lot of hard work to make the Tor network faster."

8. Tor is Not Foolproof

### [Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser €; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hiding-behind-the/9780128033524/XHTML/B9780128033401000021/B9780128033401000021.xhtml#s0015)

The Tor Browser, also known as The Onion Router (Tor), allows for anonymous communication over the internet. It anonymizes users by hiding their IP addresses, making it nearly impossible to trace or identify them. It is widely used for browsing the internet and sending emails without being identified. Tor was initially developed by the US government in 2002 but is now open for improvements by anyone with technical ability. It is used worldwide to connect to blocked websites, facilitate anonymous communication, and maintain privacy. However, Tor can also be used for criminal activities. Forensically examining devices with Tor artifacts is one way to analyze Tor, focusing on Windows operating systems. The other perspective is defeating Tor to capture communications or identify suspects who are currently using it. Tor works by directing a user's internet traffic through random relays and encrypting the data multiple times. The encrypted data passes through entry, middle, and exit relays before connecting to the user's desired target with an unencrypted connection. Overall, Tor provides effective anonymity and poses challenges for forensic analysis and investigation.


a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

    search engine for onion sites
    marketplace
    forum
    a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

c) Voluntary or alternative task: No onion. You can do this task in place of a and b. Install a darknet browser other than TOR, such as I2P or Freenet. Search, screenshot and describe examples of contents there.

d) Voluntary: Crypto hunter. Find Bitcoin address from a darknet site. Use the public ledger to find out if money has been transferred to that address.

Tips

    Alternatives for installing TOR
        https://www.torproject.org/download/ (probably easiest)
        sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher
        https://tails.net/
        https://www.whonix.org/
    OPSEC is hard, any single tool will not magically make you untraceable
    Be cautious: don't trust anonymous sites, don't enter your name or other personal details anywhere.
    O'Reilly Learning € (former Safari) is a bit pricey, but Haaga-Helia students get free access trough Haaga-Helia library A-Z page.
    Bitcoin explorer
    Other darknets include
        GNUnet
        Hypanet
        I2P
